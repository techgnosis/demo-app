The goal of this repo is to be a single Golang app that I can use for any learning or demoing that I need to do. Don't use any of this code for anything.

### Golang reminders
1. Don't modify `go.mod` or `go.sum`. They are modified during build.


### Functionality to-do
* use mysql
* use redis
* use rabbitmq
* use postgres
* log some information
* output prometheus metrics
